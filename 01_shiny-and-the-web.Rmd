# Shiny and the Web

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## Preamble

Example code for the book can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/OSUICode/)

To install the book-associated package

```r
remotes::install_github("DivadNojnarg/OSUICode")
library("OSUICode")
```

Prerequisites:

- Essential
  - Experience with shiny

- Nonessential
  - basic knoweledge of web technology (HTML, CSS, JS)

Scope:

- professional look and feel
- develop input widgets
- handle JS and CSS
- mobile-friendly
- integrate react

Part 1 of the book:

- Links between shiny and classic web technology (CSS, HTML, JS)
- Explore the web dependencies in shiny (jQuery, Bootstrap)
- Use {htmltools} to create / manipulate HTML and manage web dependencies

## Introduction

The data scientist route to web apps:

- Learn R ==> use {shiny} ==> make interactive web apps

The typical route

- Learn HTML ==> learn CSS ==> learn JS ==> learn frontend/backend libraries

- Make web apps at each stage

```{r}
library("shiny")
```

## Shiny generates HTML code

```{r hello_html, results="asis"}
# We use `message` just to help display the raw HTML that is produced
message(
  h1("Hello world")
)
```

We just made HTML from R

We can use other web tools to customise shiny apps

- custom HTML (for content)
- custom CSS (for styling)
- custom JavaScript (for interactivitiy)
- ... and make use of many templates and packages that are already written

## Be a DJ

Here is [36 lines of shiny code](
  https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/OSUICode/blob/master/inst/intro/dj-system/app.R
) (plus a few images and styles etc).

```r
# Not rendered in the book

remotes::install_github("Athospd/wavesurfer")
OSUICode::run_example("intro/dj-system", package = "OSUICode")
```

## HTML basics

Resources:

- MDN ["Introduction to HTML"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML)

HTML

- "Hypertext Markup Language"
- content for a web page
- ... and context for that content

Tags:

- Paired tags `<p>A paragraph</p>`
- Self-closing tags `<img src="url-for-the-picture.jpg" alt="description of the picture"/>`
- Purpose: structure, control and formatting

The "Box Model"

- defines the margins and dimensions of each element

"Flow layout":

- Block elements = full-width
- Inline elements = same line
- Inline-block = Inline element within which you can add block elements

"Semantic meaning"

- `<header>Content for the header element</header>`
