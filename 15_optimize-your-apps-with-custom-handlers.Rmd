# Optimize your apps with custom handlers

**Learning objectives:**

- Leverage internal Shiny JS tools to build highly interactive and optimized interfaces

## Introduction

- Many functions can update the UI from the server
- **update** functions
  - `updateTextInput()`, `updateTabSetPanel()`
- **toggle** functions
  - `hideTab()`, `showTab()`
- `renderUI()`, `insertUI()`, `removeUI()`

## The renderUI case

- `renderUI()` and `uiOutput` most famous way to **render** any HTML block from the **server**

- `update____` and `toggle` tools are component-specific, only target the element to modify

- `renderUI()` re-renders the block each time, implies poor performance in complex apps

- Book examples

## Other Shiny handlers

### insertUI case

- `insertUI` sends a R message through `session$sendInsertUI`, via the **websocket**

- content is processed by `shiny:::processDeps()`

- Finds and resolves any HTML dependency

- For each dependency, makes sure the corresponding files can be accessed on the server with `createWebDependency()` and `addResourcePath()`

- Returns a list of the HTML element and dependencies. The HTML will be accessed by `message.content.html` and dependencies by `message.content.deps`

### Example

- If the item is inserted, the item counter as well as the dropdown text are not

- We may fix that by adding extra `insertUI()` and `removeUI()` to replace those parts

- order matters: ensure that **remove** happens before **insert**

- issue: a lot of server code!

- issue: setting priorities in `observeEvent()` is a rather bad smell of poorly designed Shiny app

## Custom handlers

### Theory

**session$sendCustomMessage(type, message)**. It works by pairing with the JS method **Shiny.AddCustomMessageHandler**, tightly linked by the type parameter

- example

### Toward custom UI managment functions

- we go back to the `bs4Dash::dropdownMenu()` issue

- create `insertMessageItem` with two parameters
 - **item**, the HTML element we want to insert in the DOM
 - **session**, used to send a message to JavaScript with `session$sendCustomMessage`
- We give it a **type**, that is `add-message-item`, to be able to identify it from JavaScript with `Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler`
- some JS stuff
- This solution significantly lightens the server code since everything may be done on the JS side in one step

01:01:58	Oluwafemi Oyedele:	Thank you!!!
01:04:57	Trevin Flickinger:	Note the session$ns that actually makes sure this function can work within shiny modules
01:06:38	Trevin Flickinger:	stop
